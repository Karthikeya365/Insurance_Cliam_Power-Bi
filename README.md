Insurance Claim Dashboard – Power BI
Project Overview:
This project focuses on visualizing the financial performance of insurance claims using Power BI. The objective is to create an interactive dashboard that provides leadership with a quick and insightful overview of claims data.

Business Context:
An insurance company seeks to analyze and monitor the financial impact of claims made against policies. The dataset includes claims processed during January and February, allowing for a detailed evaluation of key performance metrics.

Dataset Details:
The dataset contains 1,000 individual claims, each described by 40 attributes.
The key variable of interest is fraud_reported, where:
1 indicates a fraudulent claim.
0 indicates a legitimate claim.
The attributes can be categorized into four main groups:
Insured Person Information
Policy Details
Incident Description
Vehicle Characteristics
Problem Statement:
The dashboard aims to analyze various factors influencing insurance claims, including:
✔ Total claims processed and the approved claim amount across different states.
✔ Incident count and its correlation with time, gender, and vehicle age.
✔ Fraud detection trends to identify potential risks and anomalies.

By leveraging Power BI’s data visualization capabilities, this project helps stakeholders gain actionable insights into claims processing, fraud detection, and financial performance.
